/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for CartagPay Rewards App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and offer progress,
 * while allowing public read access to offers. Authorization is primarily path-based.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data, accessible only to the user themselves.
 * - /offers/{offerId}: Stores offer details, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/offerProgress/{offerId}: Stores individual user's progress on offers,
 *   accessible only to the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data and offer progress.
 * - Offers are publicly readable but not writable by clients.
 * - Listing of offers is public. Listing of user offer progress is restricted to the user.
 * - The rules perform schema validation for critical fields like points and daily rewards.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Path-based authorization is used to avoid `get()` calls. The `userId` in the paths
 *   `/users/{userId}` and `/users/{userId}/offerProgress/{offerId}` is the single source
 *   of truth for access control.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Public (offers) and private (user profiles, user offer progress) data are stored in separate
 *   collections to simplify access control and optimize list operations.
